# French Election Tweet Analysis

This is code for a research project looking at the Twitter data of candidates in the 2022 French legislative elections. The research is being carried out with the University of Nottingham and [the Digital Society Project](http://digitalsocietyproject.org/).

There is no actual data in this repository. The code creates and analyses datasets, but they are stored on the University of Nottingham OneDrive.
